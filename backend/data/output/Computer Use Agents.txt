[AUTO_CLOSE] ASSISTANT: I SEE THAT THERE'S A "CONTACT REASON" FIELD WITH A RED
ASTERISK (*) THAT NEEDS TO BE FILLED. BASED ON THE TICKET CONTENT WHICH
MENTIONS A DELIVERY ISSUE ("THIS SAYS DELIVERED NOV 4"), I'LL SELECT AN
APPROPRIATE CONTACT REASON. LET ME CLICK ON THE FIELD TO SEE THE DROPDOWN
OPTIONS.

[AUTO_CLOSE] ASSISTANT: I SEE A DROPDOWN MENU WITH VARIOUS OPTIONS. SINCE
THIS IS ABOUT A DELIVERY THAT WAS MARKED AS DELIVERED BUT THE CUSTOMER
HASN'T RECEIVED IT, I'LL SELECT "DELIVERED NOT RECEIVED".

[SOCIAL_MEDIA] ASSISTANT: FROM REVIEWING THE CONVERSATIONS, I CAN SEE THAT
THESE APPEAR TO BE MOSTLY PRODUCT INQUIRIES AND CUSTOMER SERVICE
INTERACTIONS RATHER THAN NEGATIVE COMMENTS THAT NEED TO BE HIDDEN.

SINCE NONE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS APPEAR TO BE NEGATIVE COMMENTS THAT
REQUIRE MODERATION, I DON'T NEED TO USE THE HIDE BUTTON AT THIS TIME. THE
COMMENTS ARE CONSTRUCTIVE AND PRODUCT-FOCUSED.
