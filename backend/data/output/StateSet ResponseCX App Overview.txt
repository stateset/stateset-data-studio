RAG x LLM… How does it work? 

Hi Dom,

intro

Thank you for reaching out. My name is Gloria, I am a Customer Care Agent here at 
ARMRA Colostrum. I will be personally working with you today.

I understand you'd like to cancel your order and subscription. I've checked your 
order #1408919 and it appears that it has already been fulfilled and shipped. 
Unfortunately, once an order has been processed and fulfilled, we are unable to 
cancel it. However, you can find more information about our shipping policy and how 
to proceed with a return if necessary here: Shipping 
Policy](https://tryarmra.com/pages/help?hcUrl=%2Fen-US%2Fwhat-is-your-shippin
g-policy-101474).

Regarding your subscription, I see that it has already been cancelled. If there's 
anything specific that prompted your decision or if there's anything else I can assist 
you with, please let me know. Your feedback is valuable to us.
