 Service Organization’s Responsibilities 

 StateSet   is   responsible   for   its   service   commitments   and  system  requirements  and  for  designing, 
 implementing,  and  operating  effective  controls  within  the  system  to  provide  reasonable  assurance 
 that   StateSet's   service   commitments   and   system   requirements   were   achieved.   StateSet   has 
 provided   the   accompanying   assertion   titled,   “Stateset   Inc.'s   Management   Assertion”   (assertion), 
 about   the   description   and   the   suitability   of  design  of  controls  described  therein.  StateSet  is  also 
 responsible  for  preparing  the  description  and  assertion,  including  the  completeness,  accuracy,  and

 description;   selecting   the   applicable  trust  services  criteria  and  stating  the  related  controls  in  the 
 description;   and   identifying  the  risks  that  threaten  the  achievement  of  the  service  organization’s 
 service commitments and system requirements. 

 Service Auditor’s Responsibilities 

 Our   responsibility   is   to   express   an   opinion   on   the   description   and  on  the  suitability  of  design  of 
 controls   stated   in   the   description   based   on   our  examination.  Our  examination  was  conducted  in 
 accordance   with   attestation   standards   established   by   the   American   Institute  of  Certiﬁed  Public 
 Accountants.   Those   standards   require   that   we   plan   and   perform   our   examination   to   obtain 
 reasonable   assurance   about   whether,   in   all   material   respects,   the   description   is   presented   in 
 accordance  with  the  description  criteria  and  the  controls  stated  therein  were  suitably  designed  to 
 provide   reasonable   assurance   that   the   service   organization's   service   commitments   and   system 
 requirements   were   achieved   based   on   the   applicable   trust  services  criteria.  We  believe  that  the 
 evidence we obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 An  examination  of  a  description  of  a  service  organization’s  system  and  the  suitability  of  the  design 
 of controls involves—

 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
 with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement. 

 Inherent Limitations 

 The  description  is  prepared  to  meet  the  common  needs  of  a  broad  range  of  report  users  and  may 
 not,   therefore,   include   every   aspect   of   the   system   that   individual   report   users   may   consider

 important   to   meet   their   informational   needs.   There   are   inherent   limitations   in   any   system   of 
 internal   control,   including   the   possibility   of   human   error   and  the  circumvention  of  controls.  The 
 projection  to  the  future  of  any  conclusions  about  the  suitability  of  the  design  of  controls  is  subject 
 to   the   risk   that   controls   may   become   inadequate   because   of   changes   in   conditions   or   that   the 
 degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

 Other Matter 

 We  did  not  perform  any  procedures  regarding  the  operating  effectiveness  of  controls  stated  in  the 
 description and, accordingly, do not express an opinion thereon.

 are   to   provide   reasonable,   but   not   absolute,   assurance   that   controls   are   suitably   designed   and 
 operating   effectively   to   meet   the   relevant   control   objectives,   that   assets   are   protected   from 
 unauthorized 
 with 
 management’s   authorization   and   client   instructions.  Management  has  established  and  maintains 
 controls  designed  to  monitor  compliance  with  established  policies  and  procedures.  The  remainder 
 of  this  subsection  discusses  the  tone  at  the  top  as  set  by  management,  the  integrity,  ethical  values, 
 and  competence  of  StateSet  employees,  the  policies  and  procedures,  the  risk  management  process 
 and   monitoring,   and   the   roles   of   signiﬁcant   control   groups.   The   internal   control   structure   is 
 established and refreshed based on StateSet's assessment of risk facing the organization.

 Integrity   and   ethical   values   are   essential   elements   of   the   control   environment,   affecting   the 
 design,   administration   and   monitoring   of   key   processes.   Integrity   and   ethical   behavior   are   the 
 products   of   StateSet's   ethical   and   behavioral   standards,   how   they   are   communicated,   and   how 
 they  are  monitored  and  enforced  in  its  business  activities.  They  include  management’s  actions  to 
 remove  or  reduce  incentives/pressures,  and  opportunities  that  might  prompt  personnel  to  engage 
 in   dishonest,   illegal,  or  unethical  acts.  They  also  include  the  communication  of  the  entity’s  values 
 and  behavioral  standards  to  personnel  through  policy  statements  and  Code  of  Conduct,  and  by  the 
 examples   the   executives   set.   StateSet's  executive  management  recognizes  their  responsibility  to 
 foster   a   strong   ethical   environment   within   StateSet   to   determine   that   its   business   affairs   are 
 conducted   with   integrity,   and   in   accordance   with   high   standards   of   personal   and   corporate 
 conduct.   This   responsibility   is   characterized   and   reﬂected   in   the   Code   of   Conduct,   which   is 
 distributed to all applicable personnel of the organization.

 and 

 Risk Assessment Process 

 StateSet   has   deﬁned   a   risk   management   framework   for  evaluating  information  security  risk  and 
 other   relevant   forms   of   business   risk.  A  formal  risk  assessment  is  performed  at  least  annually  to 
 identify,   update,   and   assess   relevant   internal  and  external  threats  related  to  security,  which  also 
 considers  the  potential  for  fraud  (RA-02).  A  risk  register  is  maintained  to  record  the  risk  mitigation 
 strategies  for  identiﬁed  risks,  and  to  track  the  development  or  modiﬁcation  of  controls  consistent 
 with the risk mitigation strategy  (RA-03). 

 Due   to   the   company’s   heavy   reliance   on   outside   vendors   for   critical   infrastructure,   processing 
 capabilities,   and   business   functions,   the   company   has   developed   a   Vendor   Management   Policy 
 which  establishes  the  compliance  and  performance  expectations  required  of  vendors,  and  the  due 
 diligence   and   monitoring   expectations   required  of  the  Company’s  personnel.  Agreements,  which 
 in   accordance   with   the   Vendor 
 include 
 Management   Policy   (RA-06).   StateSet   collects   and   reviews   the   compliance   reports   (i.e.   SOC   2, 
 SOC 3, or ISO 27001) for its high-risk vendors on at least an annual basis  (RA-05).

 Information and Communication 

 Information  and  communication  is  an  integral  component  of  StateSet's  internal  control  system.  It 
 is   the   process   of   identifying,   capturing,   and   exchanging   information   in   the   form   and   time   frame 
 necessary  to  conduct,  manage,  and  control  the  entity’s  operations.  This  process  encompasses  the 
 primary  classes  of  transactions  of  the  organization,  including  the  dependence  on,  and  complexity

 At 

 As   part   of   the   Company’s  commitment  to  communication,  it  provides  descriptions  of  its  services 
 and   systems   on   its   website,   which   is   available   to   both   internal   personnel   and   external   users 
 (COM-01).  The  company's  commitments  with  respect  to  security  are  published  on  the  company's 
 website  (COM-03). 

 In   order   to   enable   communication   channels   from   both   internal   and   external   sources,   StateSet 
 provides   an   email   on   its   public   website   so   that   both   internal   personnel   and   external   users   can

 report  security  concerns.  Management  monitors  communications  from  the  channel  and  responds 
 in   accordance   with   the   Security   Incident   Response   Plan   (COM-05).   The   Change   Management 
 Policy  and  Security  Incident  Response  Plan  detail  the  requirements  for  communication  to  external 
 parties  following  a  system  change,  an  incident,  or  unauthorized  disclosure  of  sensitive  information 
 (COM-04). 

 Monitoring Activities 

 StateSet   performs   several   types   of   monitoring   to   assess   the   security   of   health   of   the   in-scope 
 environment   and   the   related   controls.   The   company   leverages  a  continuous  monitoring  solution

 Logging  is  enabled  and  monitoring  software  is  conﬁgured  to  collect  metrics  from  ingested  logs  to 
 detect   potential   security   threats,   unusual   system   activity,   and   monitor   system   performance,   as 
 applicable   (NET-04).   Alerting   software   is   used   to   notify   impacted   teams   of   potential   security 
 events,  and  identiﬁed  events  are  tracked  to  resolution  (NET-05).  The  Security  Steering  Committee 
 meets   quarterly   to   coordinate   security   initiatives   and   review   network   security,   management   of 
 infrastructure and discuss security risks  (NET-07)  . 

 Control Activities 

 Access Control 

 Users   are  provisioned  new  or  modiﬁed  access  to  the  in-scope  systems  (Stateset  Web  App,  Cloud 
 Platform,   Vercel,  GCP,  Heroku,  Clerk,  ArgoCD,  Google  Workspace,  Gitlab,  Rippling)  based  on  the 
 established   Onboarding   Policy   document   or   a   documented  business  reason  and  approval  by  the 
 system   owner   or   manager   (AC-07).   These   systems   are   conﬁgured   to   require   users   to   establish 
 strong,   complex   passwords   and,   for   all   in-scope   systems   a   second   form   of   authentication   is 
 required   (AC-03).   To   maintain   accountability   and   password   security,   personnel   are   assigned 
 unique  IDs  to  access  in-scope  applications,  data,  resources,  and  tools,  and  shared  accounts  are  not 
 used  (AC-02). 

 Upon  employee  or  contractor  termination,  access  to  in-scope  applications,  resources,  and  tools  is 
 removed  within  24  hours  of  last  day  (AC-08).  The  CEO  reviews  quarterly  reviews  of  user  access  to 
 the  in-scope  systems  in  accordance  with  policy  documentation  requirements  to  validate  that  user 
 access   remains   commensurate   with   job   responsibilities.   Access   identiﬁed   during   the   review   as 
 requiring revocation is completed within a timely manner  (AC-09). 

 Change Management 

 The   Company   uses  Gitlab  as  a  secure  code  repository,  which  is  conﬁgured  to  manage  changes  to 
 the  codebases  for  the  autonomous  commerce  operations  platform  to  help  ensure  version  control 
 for  secure  deployment  to  the  production  environment  (CM-01).  Separate  environments  are  used

 in   the   change   management   cycle   to   develop,   test,   and   stage   changes   prior   to   deployment   into 
 production   (CM-04).   Code   changes   are   tested   using   automated   testing   scripts   prior   to   being 
 merged  to  the  production  branch  (CM-02).  Access  to  the  code  repository  is  limited  to  appropriate 
 individuals   and   all   code   changes   require   a   merge   request   (CM-03)  .   Notiﬁcations   are   sent   to 
 personnel when changes are deployed into production  (CM-09). 

 Conﬁguration and Vulnerability Management 

 To   help   ensure   that   key   conﬁgurations   related   to   networking   ports,  protocols,  and  services,  and 
 ﬁrewalls   were   initially   conﬁgured   to   appropriately   restrict   outside   trafﬁc   and   that   they   remain 
 appropriately   restricted   over   time,   StateSet   performs   a   review   annually   of   its   key   network 
 conﬁgurations.  The  conﬁgurations  that  are  identiﬁed  during  the  review  as  needing  to  be  changed 
 are 
 on 
 infrastructure  using  GKE  Security,  and  identiﬁed  high  and  critical  vulnerabilities  are  remediated  as 
 soon   as   possible   (VM-02).   A   third   party   is   engaged   to   conduct   a   network   and   application 
 penetration  test  of  the  production  environment  at  least  annually.  Critical  and  high-risk  ﬁndings  are 
 tracked through resolution  (VM-03).

 Incident Response and Business Continuity 

 The  Company  employs  multiple  mechanisms  to  identify  potential  security  incidents  as  discussed  in 
 the  Communication  and  Monitoring  sections  above.  Conﬁrmed  incidents  are  documented,  tracked, 
 and  responded  to  according  to  the  Security  Incident  Response  Plan  (IR-02).  Following  an  incident, 
 a   'lessons  learned'  document  is  created  and  shared  with  relevant  internal  personnel  to  make  any 
 required  changes  (IR-03).  The  Security  Incident  Response  Plan  is  tested  at  least  annually  to  assess 
 effectiveness,   and   management   makes   changes  to  the  Security  Incident  Response  Plan  based  on 
 the test results  (IR-04). 

 Complementary User Entity Controls 

 The   following   user   entity   controls   are   assumed   to   be   implemented   by   user   entities   and   are 
 necessary   for   the   service   organization’s   service   commitments   and   system   requirements   to   be 
 achieved.
