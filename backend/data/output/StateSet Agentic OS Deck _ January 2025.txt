Problem

• Fragmented Tools: Existing solutions 

10M GMV e-commerce brands struggle with 
complex operations, rising costs, and a 
patchwork of tools…

force brands to juggle multiple apps and 
databases, draining time and 
profitability.

• Manual Labor and Cost Pressures → 
Labor shortages and wage inflation 
demand automated solutions that can 
handle everything from subscription 
management to warehouse logistics.

• Stagnant Legacy Systems: Standard 

CRMs or ERPs can’t adapt to the 
fast-changing demands of $10M+ GMV 
brands, let alone enterprise retailers with 
hundreds of millions in annual sales.

“Hereʼs a way to think about the market size of AI. US 
labor costs are $11T. If a company pays 2% of 
headcount expenses to get a 1050% productivity gain 
with AI, thatʼs $200B. The US enterprise software 
market today is around $150200B. So AI doubles that 
just in the base case.ˮ

Why now?

Super Intelligence Breakthroughs:

We are on the cusp of super intelligence, powered by three transformative developments:

● Grok 3 Supercomputer Cluster: Delivering advanced AI compute at an unprecedented scale.
● OpenAIʼs o3 Benchmarks: Setting new performance standards in frontier mathematics, coding, and beyond.
●

$500B Investment in Project Stargate: Fueling next-generation AI capabilities in the US.
These breakthroughs are accelerating AGI timelines and reducing the cost and complexity of automation.

Revolutionizing Agentic Software & Autonomous Operations:
Leveraging these advancements, StateSet can drive accelerated agentic software performance that enables real-time orchestration 
across commerce, manufacturing, and autonomous operations. This positions us to build truly intelligent, autonomous workflows 
powered by supercomputing resources and near- (or beyond-) human decision-making capabilities.

Addressing Surging ECommerce Complexity:

With retailers in the $10M$1B GMV range facing mounting challenges—from managing subscriptions and logistics to customer 
experience and finance—the market demands outcome-based, streamlined automation. Our advanced AI models and 
reasoning-based systems make it possible to handle sophisticated e-commerce tasks, creating a once-in-a-generation opportunity 
to simplify and future-proof these operations.

Scaling Enterprise Growth & Marketplace Expansion:

As StateSet matures, weʼll target larger enterprise retailers and B2B operations GMVs of $100M$1B) by automating complex 
workflows that traditionally require entire departments—unlocking $1M ACVs and exponential revenue growth. Additionally, the 
imminent launch of our AI Worker Marketplace will empower developers to build specialized modules (e.g., last-mile logistics, 
advanced analytics), enabling us to capture per-module fees and scale ARR dramatically.
