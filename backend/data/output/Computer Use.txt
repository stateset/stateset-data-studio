The shift to computer use automation

Faced with growing operational demands, businesses across industries 

are encountering significant challenges in managing repetitive 

computer-based tasks. Routine activities like manual data entry, system 

updates, form submissions, and navigating multiple interfaces often 

result in productivity bottlenecks and increased potential for human 

error. Initially handled through traditional manual workflows, these 

processes frequently lead to inefficiencies and strain organizational 

resources.
